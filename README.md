# Primes---Java
A small Java project which does some computations dealing with primes.  
Operations include:  
1. Main:    
The main file where the user can call the functions in Prime.  
2. Test:   
 A JUnit test file.  
3. Prime:  
 A file containing functions which:  
<ul>checks if a number is a prime</ul>    
<ul>find all primes up to a number</ul>      
<ul>Euler's phi function</ul>    
<ul>the gcd of two numbers - Recursive</ul>    
<ul>check if two numbers are comprime</ul>
